I wrote something for real! These hours are legit, I played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life. I was young and didn't really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and I had a really bad pc, which i still own. TF2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics, but it was one of the more fun games I installed. I met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side. The community back then was more humble compared to nowadays. You have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunny/gross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game. When really, it doesn't even matter if you win or lose. However, you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way! Although you never know what kinda person you're going to meet on this game. In my honest opinion, if you want to have a game to just waste time on (and money) or just mess around with people you know (which is what I do now), this is perfect. Esspecially the mann vs. machine co-op. I mainly play that now. Although to me, the game lost its touch, update wise, and I moved onto other games. I believe it's worth a shot to try it out but other than that, I'd keep it as a casual game. I don't think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because it's being flooded by crude people. Atleast from my experiance after over about 4+ years of playing it just got worse and worse. You will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it. You'll be more stressed than actually having fun, I'll tell you that! Although in all seriousness, this game is losing its touch and probably isn't worth making it your main game MAINLY because the updates they've been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be. BUT, it's a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun! All you'll really notice nowdays is...people really love to trade more than actually play. Living off as a free to play would be very tough and you'd need to be patient with items you would want, unless you got that MONEY! Hope this helps. One last thing, I am not saying this game is bad in any way. I am saying that it's worth trying and playing with friends, or even meeting people! Although there are some downsides that you won't like, such as some stuff I pointed out above. Strictly towards the community. I personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing. Have it as a once in a while game, because it's nothing to be big about, unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there. Just give it a shot and see what you think!

I actually find it a LOT more fun now! I think Jerma summed up this game pretty nicely... \"Maybe you got like two Pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago. They don't have any hats, they're spraying  and they're having a blast. They might even be at the wrong point. They might be going backwards to the point that's already been capped. On the same team, there's a Scout with a Hale's Own Scattergun. He's got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak, he just got 18. He's going 'I just got 18, sick!' He runs up the stairs, he's trying his  off. He's get *beeping noises* dodging the 'Oh, the sentry almost got me!' He looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on Gorge and there's two sandwich Heavies having a ing picnic. So he stops for a second and goes, 'Two... nnnggh!' so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldier's rocket next door... ...The two sandwich Heavies then decide to move their picnic. There's ants. 'There's ants here, honey. I wanna get out of here.' So they get up, they pack their sandwiches, pack up their lunches, and their breakfast, and whatever the  they're eating. They get up and walk toward the door to go to RED because they think, 'That spot near the A point for RED is pretty good.' They walk out the door, and they see four Level 3 Sentry Guns pointing at them. They get shot a million times and blow up, and there's like nine Engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions. The BLU Scout, at this point, respawns, and walks by the at least 3-4 statues because we all know there's four people AFK when you play this game, you go by the museum of people standing still. He walks out the door and readies his weapon, he's ready, 'I'm going to get another 20 killstreak, just you watch Gaben, I'm going to praise Gaben!' And he goes forward and starts shooting, and he gets backstabbed by a Spy that has been sitting with the Cloak and Dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds.\" Normally when I do reviews, I turn into a critic and start to examine that game, pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score. However, Team Fortress 2 (or TF2 for short) helped me make so many memories that if I actually tried to make a fair review on it, it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review. Team Fortress 2, is, obviously, an amazing game. The teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult. You need teammates in order to survive and win. The graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game. I'm not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot. I love this game because of its charm. The game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters, you can't help to love all of them at some point. Scout is cocky and overconfident. Spy, another one of the characters in the game, is technically Scout's father. Soldier is a crazed WWII American patriot. He never actually joined the Army, but instead, he had his own personal Nazi killing spree. His roommate was a magician named Merasmus, who grew to hate Soldier. Pyro is mysterious, but portrays the world as one big happy paradise, known as Pyroland. Demoman is a Scottish alcoholic who, due to Merasmus, lost his eye that is now haunted. Heavy, although he appears to be dim-witted, is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters. Engineer is very intelligent as well, and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with RED and BLU continue. Medic isn't fond of normal forms of medicine, but is still an important member nonetheless. Sniper is from New Zealand, but was raised in Australia. He prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to Superman's. Spy is the master of disguise, and is technically Scout's father, as said before. Of all the characters, he appears to be the most \"mature\" and appears to be the ringleader at many times. Not only that, but the game has an interesting story. I would not like to get too detailed with it. However, it makes little to no sense but is still funny, engaging, and gives TF2 much more depth. There is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where Mann Co. is being attacked, so the mercenaries have to defend it, called Mann vs. Machine. This game mode ties in with the TF comics, which explain many characters' backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review. The other comics (all of which can be found on TF2's official website) are all funny and charming in their own way as well. The community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times, but in the end, it's still an overall great community. I've seen people give out stuff, others mentor some of the newbs (something I do as well) along with much, much more. Yes. the game is considered a \"pay-to-win game\" but it isn't necessarily a pay-to-win game. With lots of patience, you will get what you want from the game, whether it be hats, weapons, or whatever it is you want. The game has a learning curve that isn't too steep, but become dedicated and you'll fall in love with it. No matter how many times you rage to a W+M1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak, or cheer when you unbox an Unusual, or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things, Team Fortress 2 has been a huge part of my PC gaming life and without it, I would be as bored as hell. I cannot recommend this game enough, and I hope that many more memories are made on here. Valve may be cash cows, but you can't help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games. Portal, Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike, but this game stands out from the rest to me. Do I recommend this game? Yes, yes, yes, YES.", "profile_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi", "username": "[CotC] King Conga Gandhi", "friend_player_level": 17, "num_reviews": 42, "num_groups": 104, "num_found_helpful": 795, "rating": "Recommended", "num_screenshots": 1278, "num_found_funny": 7, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_possible": 518, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.5965250965250966, "num_achievements_attained": 309}, "num_friends": 266, "num_workshop_items": 3, "steam_id_number": "emperorgandhi", "num_comments": 26, "num_voted_helpfulness": 858, "num_guides": 3, "date_posted": "May 7, 2015, 4:18PM", "num_badges": 13}

Being ranked as the third most-played game [steamcharts.com] on Steam, Team Fortress 2 is probably one of the best free-to-play games we've got. Why is it so popular? Let's take a look, shall we? First off, the obvious: It's free. 100% free. This means its accessible to everyone on Steam. This is just the icing on the cake though. What really shines about TF2 is the game itself. Team Fortress 2 usually consists of two teams (Red and Blue) going head to head against each other. Sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other. There are many, many maps and modes, such as Payload, Capture Points, and Mann VS Machine. But the general idea no matter the map or mode is to KILL EVERYTHING THAT MOVES! And my god, is it fun to do so. The game has 9 playable mercenaries, each actually being a certain \"class\". Each class is divided into 3 different roles: Offense, Defense, and Support. Let's go over each role and class. Offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team. These are your main attack force. Scouts are the speedy hit and run class, with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items. Soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers, which gives them not only power, but mobility due to the ability known as \"rocket jumping\". The Pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire, as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast. Defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map. Overall, the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups. Demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by. Heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces. Heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off. Engineers can build Sentry Guns for effective area defense, as well as build Teleporters and Dispensers for logistical support of the team. Support classes cannot hold the fight on their own, but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their team's favor. They offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game. Whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed, the support classes are always handy to have around. Medics are the team healers, capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments. Spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats. Snipers excel at long range, also eliminating key threats, as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates. Next, let's look at the presentation. TF2 has a very unqiue art style. It's somewhat cartoonish, but very appealing. It's simple, and un-complex. But it doesn't need to be complex. It's simplicity is it's strength. Everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on, what a specific model or item is, and they all stand out. The soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy, especially the main theme. I personally have it as a ringtone/alarm tone on my smartphone! :) One of the best aspects of TF2 is the Steam Workshop. Users can submit designs for items and weapons, and possibly have them added to the game! A very lucrative sub-market has also emerged from this game in the form of the Crate Keys. That's a whole different ballgame in and of itself, so we won't get into it here. During normal gameplay on most servers, you can obtain random items, weapons, and sometimes crates, and taunts....through the item drops system. You can only receive so many drops per week, and you will get them randomly as you play. You can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenary's loadout, or you can use them to craft other items, hats, and weapons. You can take multiples of items and craft them into Scrap, then Reclaimed Metal, then Refined Metal. You can then use these metals to craft specific class weapons/items, among other things. The crafting system is simple yet robust, with lots of possiblities. Some of it is very luck based. You can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the Steam Market! All-in-all, Team Fortress 2 is just a very fun game. Endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game, especially if you play with friends on your favorite server. Probably the best free-to-play game on Steam. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=383235670 Highly Recommended Be sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!", "profile_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse", "username": "Nerd House", "friend_player_level": 36, "num_reviews": 118, "num_groups": 29, "num_found_helpful": 1247, "rating": "Recommended", "num_screenshots": 66, "num_found_funny": 1, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_possible": 46, "num_achievements_percentage": 1.0, "num_achievements_attained": 46}, "num_friends": 229, "num_workshop_items": 1, "steam_id_number": "nerdhouse", "num_comments": 30, "num_voted_helpfulness": 1381, "num_guides": 10, "date_posted": "Oct 23, 2014, 8:20PM", "num_badges": 32}

This is where it really starts; To play the simulator correctly, you have to spend money in the market place, made by Valve. After that, while you play the minigame, you can find hats which you can trade for, or collect! There is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats, just like you! After you collect enough items and/or hats, try joining a trade server! There, the REAL fun begins!

Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fulfill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels. The game has an active dev team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as weapons or game modes. At the time of this review, there are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'. Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objective or objectives for each team to achieve. 'Mann Versus Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, \"Mann Up\", gives rewards upon completing a \"tour\". In addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available. In addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them. The game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play. I have been playing since November 2007 and I still return to the game on a regular basis.", "profile_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/id/youcanhas", "username": "Puddington Bear", "friend_player_level": 109, "num_reviews": 6, "num_groups": 73, "num_found_helpful": 505, "rating": "Recommended", "num_screenshots": 3, "num_found_funny": 1, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_possible": 518, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.8378378378378378, "num_achievements_attained": 434}, "num_friends": 658, "num_workshop_items": 0, "steam_id_number": "youcanhas", "num_comments": 94, "num_voted_helpfulness": 558, "num_guides": 0, "date_posted": "Feb 15, 2014, 6:13AM", "num_badges": 143}

But for some reason, anyone who sees you with it call you a total noob... Month 1: You just became premium! Yay! And you think you're starting to get this whole \"trading system\", but you don't exactly see why it's so important to everyone. Months 2-6: You are addicted to trading, more than playing the game itself. You have countless hats, stranges and keys, and anyone you trade with and all your friends admire how extremely rich you are. Months 6-12: You've just changed your name to (xxxxxxx) #RoadToUnusual. You really think you can make it as a big time trader. (A bit scamming, of course.) 1+ Years: You have 5 unusuals, and countless earbuds. You love your inventory more than anything else in the world. Your profile showcase is an exhibit of your coolest items and achivements in TF2. But then, one day... You come home from school, toss your backpack on your bed and wait for you PC to boot. You open steam, as well as TF2Outpst, looking for cool trades. You see someone selling a cool unusual you want, so you send him a trade offer. But when you open \"My Inventory\", It's empty. \"Steam must just be drunk again\", you think to yourself. But not this time... not this time. You slowly, trembling with an odd sensation of fear, anticipation and rage open your inventory history to find out that some scumbag named \"Green Lantern\" stole all your items. -Unusual Counterfeit Billycock -Unusual Shooter's Tin Topi -Unusual Team Captain -Unusual Bonk Boy -Unusual Towering Pillar Of hats -Earbuds -Earbuds -Earbuds -Earbuds -Earbuds -Earbuds -Earbuds At that very moment, hundreds of suicidal thoughts cross your mind. You throw up all over your keyboard, and start screaming. Just screaming. You break down on your knees, start crying like a little girl and let the tears flow all over your red, sweaty body. You go to sleep, and dream all about your inventory. The purple of the unusuals, The green of the genuines, The blue of the vintages... And you forget all about it.

I no longer cared about playing for fun, I only cared about the 'hats' I \"borrowed\" my mommys credit card and bought more hats. I had so many hats, I loved them all. But then someone traded me, I accepted. They offered an Unusual for all my hats. It was so sexy looking, I put up all my hats and traded. But no Unusual, He scammed me. I lost it all. I was so sad I cried for hours. Later that night I prayed to Gaben for my hats back. I went to bed after praying. I felt warm. I looked behind me, It was Gaben! He said \"This is Gabe Newell\" and handed me a Burning Team Captain. Then I woke up, I was wearing my Burning Team Captain and I was naked. I saw Gabe leave through the window, he looked back at me and winked. Hats are love.

It's your decision to buy from the store. It's your decision to craft metal and hats. It's your decision to play, idle, or even be a teammate and balance the rosters.

Playing with, or without a team of friends, competitive or casual, this game delivers consistent fun that never really gets old. The dynamics and balance of class-based shooter gameplay that exists in this game is unparalleled anywhere else that Ive seen, with no one way to play being superior. The pay-to-advance mechanics in other freemium games aren't present here, as aside from a few utility unlocks and different play styles, the stock weapons are largely the best for every character, with the microtransation and trading economies being largely cosmetic and for non gameplay-affecting in nature. The support for competitive play is amazing, with all levels of skill supported, and many servers dedicated to skill improvement, in addition to casual gaming. The community is also amazing, with no shortage of community content, media, artwork, and a plethora of gaming networks that bring the TF2niverse to life outside the game, and into the rest of the world. (Still waiting for the civilian bobblehead from Meet the Sniper) There is also a virtual macro economy, with Valve's random item distribution system leading to a diverse market for all things TF2, within TF2; hats, specialty weapons, memorabilia items, that can all be used in-game to customize your character and add depth to your actions in-game and within the steam community. The bugs due to lack of optimization, and occasional grief caused by players abusing vote-related moderation systems are the only two things that I can complain about with this game, as it's good, wholesome fun regardless if you're just starting, or are a competitive pro. Even though this game is nearly 7 years old, the community that plays it really brings it to life once you get into it and with the nonstop fun that it provides, Its one of the genuinely few online games that I can wholeheartedly give my seal of approval to. Do i reccomend this game? Of course. There's no boring tedium of waiting around for your opponent to act, and hard-set roles and proceedures that needs to be adhered to, lest your team's fun gets ruined thanks to one person slipping up like in many of the other games these days. (heck, you can charge at a rocket launcher-wielding enemy with a claymore sword, and kill him if you pull it off correctly) I think it allows for more personal expression and playstyles than i think exist in a lot of games. 9.5/10 for doing everything right that can be done in an online shooter, and actually listening to the concerns of the community. Also for providing not just something fun to play, but a universe to be part of.", "profile_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/id/323425621343254657435674", "username": "Captain Blades #TF2ArmsDeal", "friend_player_level": 44, "num_reviews": 7, "num_groups": 30, "num_found_helpful": 170, "rating": "Recommended", "num_screenshots": 59, "num_found_funny": 0, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_possible": 518, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.9536679536679536, "num_achievements_attained": 494}, "num_friends": 76, "num_workshop_items": 0, "steam_id_number": "323425621343254657435674", "num_comments": 2, "num_voted_helpfulness": 178, "num_guides": 1, "date_posted": "Mar 19, 2014, 10:38PM", "num_badges": 32}

I wrote something for real! These hours are legit, I played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life. I was young and didn't really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and I had a really bad pc, which i still own. TF2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics, but it was one of the more fun games I installed. I met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side. The community back then was more humble compared to nowadays. You have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunny/gross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game. When really, it doesn't even matter if you win or lose. However, you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way! Although you never know what kinda person you're going to meet on this game. In my honest opinion, if you want to have a game to just waste time on (and money) or just mess around with people you know (which is what I do now), this is perfect. Esspecially the mann vs. machine co-op. I mainly play that now. Although to me, the game lost its touch, update wise, and I moved onto other games. I believe it's worth a shot to try it out but other than that, I'd keep it as a casual game. I don't think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because it's being flooded by crude people. Atleast from my experiance after over about 4+ years of playing it just got worse and worse. You will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it. You'll be more stressed than actually having fun, I'll tell you that! Although in all seriousness, this game is losing its touch and probably isn't worth making it your main game MAINLY because the updates they've been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be. BUT, it's a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun! All you'll really notice nowdays is...people really love to trade more than actually play. Living off as a free to play would be very tough and you'd need to be patient with items you would want, unless you got that MONEY! Hope this helps. One last thing, I am not saying this game is bad in any way. I am saying that it's worth trying and playing with friends, or even meeting people! Although there are some downsides that you won't like, such as some stuff I pointed out above. Strictly towards the community. I personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing. Have it as a once in a while game, because it's nothing to be big about, unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there. Just give it a shot and see what you think!

I actually find it a LOT more fun now! I think Jerma summed up this game pretty nicely... \"Maybe you got like two Pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago. They don't have any hats, they're spraying  and they're having a blast. They might even be at the wrong point. They might be going backwards to the point that's already been capped. On the same team, there's a Scout with a Hale's Own Scattergun. He's got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak, he just got 18. He's going 'I just got 18, sick!' He runs up the stairs, he's trying his  off. He's get *beeping noises* dodging the 'Oh, the sentry almost got me!' He looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on Gorge and there's two sandwich Heavies having a ing picnic. So he stops for a second and goes, 'Two... nnnggh!' so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldier's rocket next door... ...The two sandwich Heavies then decide to move their picnic. There's ants. 'There's ants here, honey. I wanna get out of here.' So they get up, they pack their sandwiches, pack up their lunches, and their breakfast, and whatever the  they're eating. They get up and walk toward the door to go to RED because they think, 'That spot near the A point for RED is pretty good.' They walk out the door, and they see four Level 3 Sentry Guns pointing at them. They get shot a million times and blow up, and there's like nine Engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions. The BLU Scout, at this point, respawns, and walks by the at least 3-4 statues because we all know there's four people AFK when you play this game, you go by the museum of people standing still. He walks out the door and readies his weapon, he's ready, 'I'm going to get another 20 killstreak, just you watch Gaben, I'm going to praise Gaben!' And he goes forward and starts shooting, and he gets backstabbed by a Spy that has been sitting with the Cloak and Dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds.\" Normally when I do reviews, I turn into a critic and start to examine that game, pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score. However, Team Fortress 2 (or TF2 for short) helped me make so many memories that if I actually tried to make a fair review on it, it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review. Team Fortress 2, is, obviously, an amazing game. The teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult. You need teammates in order to survive and win. The graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game. I'm not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot. I love this game because of its charm. The game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters, you can't help to love all of them at some point. Scout is cocky and overconfident. Spy, another one of the characters in the game, is technically Scout's father. Soldier is a crazed WWII American patriot. He never actually joined the Army, but instead, he had his own personal Nazi killing spree. His roommate was a magician named Merasmus, who grew to hate Soldier. Pyro is mysterious, but portrays the world as one big happy paradise, known as Pyroland. Demoman is a Scottish alcoholic who, due to Merasmus, lost his eye that is now haunted. Heavy, although he appears to be dim-witted, is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters. Engineer is very intelligent as well, and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with RED and BLU continue. Medic isn't fond of normal forms of medicine, but is still an important member nonetheless. Sniper is from New Zealand, but was raised in Australia. He prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to Superman's. Spy is the master of disguise, and is technically Scout's father, as said before. Of all the characters, he appears to be the most \"mature\" and appears to be the ringleader at many times. Not only that, but the game has an interesting story. I would not like to get too detailed with it. However, it makes little to no sense but is still funny, engaging, and gives TF2 much more depth. There is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where Mann Co. is being attacked, so the mercenaries have to defend it, called Mann vs. Machine. This game mode ties in with the TF comics, which explain many characters' backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review. The other comics (all of which can be found on TF2's official website) are all funny and charming in their own way as well. The community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times, but in the end, it's still an overall great community. I've seen people give out stuff, others mentor some of the newbs (something I do as well) along with much, much more. Yes. the game is considered a \"pay-to-win game\" but it isn't necessarily a pay-to-win game. With lots of patience, you will get what you want from the game, whether it be hats, weapons, or whatever it is you want. The game has a learning curve that isn't too steep, but become dedicated and you'll fall in love with it. No matter how many times you rage to a W+M1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak, or cheer when you unbox an Unusual, or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things, Team Fortress 2 has been a huge part of my PC gaming life and without it, I would be as bored as hell. I cannot recommend this game enough, and I hope that many more memories are made on here. Valve may be cash cows, but you can't help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games. Portal, Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike, but this game stands out from the rest to me. Do I recommend this game? Yes, yes, yes, YES.", "profile_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi", "username": "[CotC] King Conga Gandhi", "friend_player_level": 17, "num_reviews": 42, "num_groups": 104, "num_found_helpful": 795, "rating": "Recommended", "num_screenshots": 1278, "num_found_funny": 7, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_possible": 518, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.5965250965250966, "num_achievements_attained": 309}, "num_friends": 266, "num_workshop_items": 3, "steam_id_number": "emperorgandhi", "num_comments": 26, "num_voted_helpfulness": 858, "num_guides": 3, "date_posted": "May 7, 2015, 4:18PM", "num_badges": 13}

Being ranked as the third most-played game [steamcharts.com] on Steam, Team Fortress 2 is probably one of the best free-to-play games we've got. Why is it so popular? Let's take a look, shall we? First off, the obvious: It's free. 100% free. This means its accessible to everyone on Steam. This is just the icing on the cake though. What really shines about TF2 is the game itself. Team Fortress 2 usually consists of two teams (Red and Blue) going head to head against each other. Sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other. There are many, many maps and modes, such as Payload, Capture Points, and Mann VS Machine. But the general idea no matter the map or mode is to KILL EVERYTHING THAT MOVES! And my god, is it fun to do so. The game has 9 playable mercenaries, each actually being a certain \"class\". Each class is divided into 3 different roles: Offense, Defense, and Support. Let's go over each role and class. Offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team. These are your main attack force. Scouts are the speedy hit and run class, with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items. Soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers, which gives them not only power, but mobility due to the ability known as \"rocket jumping\". The Pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire, as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast. Defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map. Overall, the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups. Demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by. Heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces. Heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off. Engineers can build Sentry Guns for effective area defense, as well as build Teleporters and Dispensers for logistical support of the team. Support classes cannot hold the fight on their own, but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their team's favor. They offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game. Whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed, the support classes are always handy to have around. Medics are the team healers, capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments. Spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats. Snipers excel at long range, also eliminating key threats, as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates. Next, let's look at the presentation. TF2 has a very unqiue art style. It's somewhat cartoonish, but very appealing. It's simple, and un-complex. But it doesn't need to be complex. It's simplicity is it's strength. Everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on, what a specific model or item is, and they all stand out. The soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy, especially the main theme. I personally have it as a ringtone/alarm tone on my smartphone! :) One of the best aspects of TF2 is the Steam Workshop. Users can submit designs for items and weapons, and possibly have them added to the game! A very lucrative sub-market has also emerged from this game in the form of the Crate Keys. That's a whole different ballgame in and of itself, so we won't get into it here. During normal gameplay on most servers, you can obtain random items, weapons, and sometimes crates, and taunts....through the item drops system. You can only receive so many drops per week, and you will get them randomly as you play. You can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenary's loadout, or you can use them to craft other items, hats, and weapons. You can take multiples of items and craft them into Scrap, then Reclaimed Metal, then Refined Metal. You can then use these metals to craft specific class weapons/items, among other things. The crafting system is simple yet robust, with lots of possiblities. Some of it is very luck based. You can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the Steam Market! All-in-all, Team Fortress 2 is just a very fun game. Endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game, especially if you play with friends on your favorite server. Probably the best free-to-play game on Steam. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=383235670 Highly Recommended Be sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!", "profile_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse", "username": "Nerd House", "friend_player_level": 36, "num_reviews": 118, "num_groups": 29, "num_found_helpful": 1247, "rating": "Recommended", "num_screenshots": 66, "num_found_funny": 1, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_possible": 46, "num_achievements_percentage": 1.0, "num_achievements_attained": 46}, "num_friends": 229, "num_workshop_items": 1, "steam_id_number": "nerdhouse", "num_comments": 30, "num_voted_helpfulness": 1381, "num_guides": 10, "date_posted": "Oct 23, 2014, 8:20PM", "num_badges": 32}

It also breaks a lot of conventions in the genre and has continued to be a proving ground for what a game is truly capable of. For the past five years or so TF2 has consistently evolved through a series of major updates introducing new game-play elements(minor patches for bugs are issued at least bi-weekly), and, occasionally, festive seasonal updates that make TF2 more eventful. Unlike a lot of FPS out there, Team Fortress provides plenty of things to do other than just \"shot bullet\". TF2 has a really nice replay feature which you can direct, star in, edit, and render in ber quality(regardless of system specs) your own wartime films that can be posted to YouTube via in-game function. TF2 was also one of the first FPS to have a tradeable item drop system which has produced a very large and viable trading community and market where loot found or crafted in the game is exchanged for other in-game valuables like fancy apparel, rare Items/Weapons, games from the steam store, or even real world $ on the black-market. This micro-economic meta-game is what will essentially help support the game indefinitely, and rewards players for there time spent playing the game, and making it a worthy investment for learning the game. The only downside I can note about Team Fortress 2 is that it is currently over 12 gigabytes in size and it will eventually get much larger if it continues on this upgrading trend. Being the king of free to play games, I give Team Fortress 2 a perfect score 10 out of 10.", "profile_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197975217935", "username": "WASH", "friend_player_level": 40, "num_reviews": 30, "num_groups": 51, "num_found_helpful": 114, "rating": "Recommended", "num_screenshots": 2572, "num_found_funny": 0, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_possible": 518, "num_achievements_percentage": 0.6737451737451737, "num_achievements_attained": 349}, "num_friends": 300, "num_workshop_items": 0, "steam_id_number": "76561197975217935", "num_comments": 2, "num_voted_helpfulness": 124, "num_guides": 0, "date_posted": "Aug 9, 2013, 12:58PM", "num_badges": 49}

When I say ''going strong'' I usually like to think so in the community workshop and hat section. But on a serious note, this game is absolutely sensational, fun and arguably flawless. So, what's the best of it now? Well, it's totally free and definitely worthy of the quote; ''The most fun you can have online.'' coming from the editors of PC Gamer magazine. The game has a wide and diverse selection of 9 different classes, ranging from their own unique abilities and strategies that can be performed against the opposing team. Similiar to a ''rock, paper, scissors'' scenario, where everything is fair and there are no ''over-powered'' classes. The fast, Boston-talking and even more fast running Scout, to the towering, minigun-wielding hulk of a Russian man, known as the Heavy. Every character class usually represents a soldier in a common FPS' of some sort. What I truly love about these characters is the fact that Valve has openly breathed life, vibrant personalities, characteristics and nationalities into this rag-tag bunch. I also enjoyed the customization of weapons and accessories, named after the witty puns, along with the slight ethnic slur and referenced culture of that said character. This really brings out the comedic flare within the game and shows that humour can mix amusement in along with entertainment the players from around the globe can express and relate to, depending on the gamer's nationality. When it comes to the plot of the game, the elements of storytelling isn't entirely shown into clear perception. It mainly focuses on the two, competitive industries of RED (Reliable Excavation Demolition) and BLU. (Builders League United) Who both subsequently conquer half of the world, known as the Badlands. Each corporation administers its half of the world with a multi-disciplined army of paper pushers. One of those ''paper pushers'' is you and your whole team, when playing this game. A fantastic thing to note in this game is the fact that it's holiday themed. Either new campaigns modeled after a specific holiday, down to the newly cashed in, fan made hats are launched to the public to bring in funds for both Valve and the original creator at hand. Halloween, Christmas, Easter just to name a few are a great example and addition to the game's growing campaign and community. It's also important to note that the game is getting updated at a steady pace, with the occasional UI updates and other fun concepts, such as poses and character interactions being frequently implemented to wet the appetites of the individual player's preference. I don't have much to complain about this game, other than the fact that majority of the servers you connect to, you'll most likely encounter 13-year-olds who constantly nag and try their luck to command the rest of the whole team, which sometimes resorts to foreign/eastern european person nagging about the 13-year-old's nagging, so it's not rare to see a big kick off between young kids and ignorant foreign kids going absolute bonkers on a connected match. It's more fun to not say a word at this point in time and just watch the ultimate climax between the raging two forces. I definitely recommend this game. Not just down to the fact that it's free, but because it still remains fun to this day and constant updates on campaigns and official hat accessories keep this game alive, making the game overall timeless...which, doesn't affect the game's mechanics at all but, only along the lines of taunts and so on and so forth.", "profile_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheekybanterlads", "username": "DeliciousHotSchmoes", "friend_player_level": null, "num_reviews": 0, "num_groups": null, "num_found_helpful": 165, "rating": "Recommended", "num_screenshots": 0, "num_found_funny": 1, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_possible": null, "num_achievements_percentage": null, "num_achievements_attained": null}, "num_friends": null, "num_workshop_items": 0, "steam_id_number": "cheekybanterlads", "num_comments": 0, "num_voted_helpfulness": 196, "num_guides": 0, "date_posted": "Nov 2, 2014, 6:16AM", "num_badges": null}

It never gets old because no two matches are the same, something will always be different as soon as those spawn doors open and you run out onto the front lines. There are many fun and interesting weapons that you can combine together that suit your play style and strategies, along with finding the perfect class or classes that just fit your style of play and keep you coming back for more. There are are many fun game modes, official and custom, that you can play. As well as tons of fun official and custom maps to enjoy. My personal favorite game mode would by Capture the Flag on my favorite map 2Fort. Even though TF2 is 7 years old its still very active and keeps getting update with minor as well as major updates which add all sorts of new content. Usually the major updates are pretty good, but there are times when they can fall flat. But that doesn't happen too often. BONUS DUCKS! And of course I wouldn't dare to end this without mentioning the hats. The many hats and misc items for every class allow you to stand out among your fellow players and make you look unique. There are tons of unique, interesting, and ridiculous combination you can make by combining the wide assortment of cosmetic items and I simply love it! This game is awesome and overall unique compared to the other multi-player FPSs I have played and that's what makes it so great, it's different and that's the way I like it. Also, the Pyro is a light bulb until proven otherwise, and even if he is proven to be otherwise, disregard it and continue believing he is a light bulb, because he is a light bulb.

The game revolves around a set of 9 classes, each of which have strengths and weaknesses and counters, whose duty it is to conquer the opposition. The thing about TF2, at least for me, is the artstyle. The comic cartoonyness of the characters and world is incredibly fun and light. It's the perfect game to blow off some steam and relax after a long day. The players, at least in my experience, are all generally really nice. I feel this is because being \"bad\" at TF2 is not really a factor. Regardless of your skill level, how much time you've spent on TF2, or how much money, everyone can contribute and everyone can have a great time. One of the strongest parts of the game is that losing, dying or being killed doesn't lead to hate or anger or frustration. A game in TF2 can last from 3 to 10 minutes, and these short rounds contribute to a lack of concern if you lose. Not in a bad way, not in a way which results in you not caring about the game in general, but in a way where if you lose you don't blame yourself, or your team mates, for the loss. It's refreshing and fantastic. Hugely recommended from myself. I've spent about 550+ hours in the game, am in no way a master, half-decent maybe, and I have no reason to stop playing. The game is consistently updated with new maps, items, lore and content and I look forward to many more hundreds of hours of gameplay.

My cursor moves even slower as I move it towards the giant, green \"USE KEY\" button.

A large clump of feces leaves my  very quick, as my eyes look at the item I have just been given by the Holy Gaben himself. Another clump starts sliding out as I stand up to run to my dad to tell him that I've just unboxed a Ghastly Gibus. My dad cries as he suddenly gets his Steam account hacked by OpTic.

I will never play TF2 with you. \" But one day, one of my friends was feeling down, and he's really into TF2, so I offered to play with him. And it made him happy and not sad and that was good. Then another one of my friends told me that if I played 70 hours of TF2, he'd buy me Skyrim. I don't have my own money to buy things online with; all the money I make online goes to my friends' PayPals. So I said yes, and I started logging hours. It was slow going at first. I said to him, \"It's a good game, but I'm really bad at it. And I guess that's okay - everyone's kinda bad at it. But I'll never be like you and my other friends who play this. You won't get me addicted to TF2; I'm doing this for Skyrim.\" After I got Skyrim, it became my bae and I was the clingy girlfriend. As my burning passion for being a male lizardbeast died down, I started playing TF2. Mostly because, being F2P, many of my friends played and still play it. So we played TF2. It was gradual, my downfall. But it was inevitable, and in hindsight, even predictable. I want to say I'm not addicted to TF2, but then I'd be lying, because once I played for six hours straight to achieve a score of 420 and I didn't stop 'til I hit that eight hour mark. I played TF2 for more than six in' hours, man. I could've stopped at 420. No, I could've stopped an hour or two in. And yet I didn't. I started playing TF2 regularly, sometimes for long periods of time. I won't say that that was my aforementioned 'downfall'. No, it would have to be me being around TF2 bloggers on Tumblr. I watched and learned about other fans and their interests. But let me just say. Playing TF2 is one thing. Playing TF2 often is part of that one thing. But reading and writing shipping fanfiction about TF2? Getting innocents into shipping fanfiction about TF2? Well, I wish I didn't fall into this black hole of gay, but it's too late now. I'm sorry. Play TF2. But do so carefully.

This game is a MUST-PLAY!!! The cartoon feeling combined with the combat makes this game a different one from the other FPS games. What also makes TF2 also a unique FPS is that it is a Multiplayer only video game. TF2 is one of the games that you don't have a pro to enjoy the game. For other FPS games, such as COD , you would have to be a pro at the game in order to get the other weapons. For TF2, you just have to play a certain amount of time and then later you will acquire some new items! If you're lucky, you could get a misc or even a hat. There are many different qualities for items and weapons in the game. They are Normal, Unique, Strange, Vintage, Genuine, Unusual, Haunted, Collector, Community and Self-Made. There are 9 classes which are the Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy. These classes are divided into 3 categories. They are Offensive, Defense and Support. Each class specalise in a particular area. The Scout can double jump and is the fastest out of all class which means he can escape from danger with no diffculty. The Soldier can rocket jump to get into higher areas. Pyro can burn enemies and can do compression blast which blasts projectiles away such as rockets and grenades. The Demoman is able to make traps for enemies. Heavy is able to take a lot of damage and has the most health. Engineers are able to construct buildings such as a Sentry Gun to defend points and support the rest of the team. Medics can heal fellow teammates so they are able to survive in battle longer. Sniper can do a significant amount of damage with sniper rifle. Spy can disguise as the enemy team and can sap Engineers' buildings to disable them. As you start Team Fortress 2, there are detailed tutorials that teaches you how to play the particular class efficently. When you finished these tutorials, there is a \"Training\" Mode which enables you to sharpen your skills on bots. Training Mode also has several diffculties. TF2 has many gamemodes. Some examples are Capture the Flag, King of the Hill and Payload. Each gamemode has a certain objective and requires everyone in the team to contribute. Team Fortress 2 is one of those games that requires a lot of teamwork. If there is no teamwork, the team is unable to advance to the next point. A unique gamemode called Mann Vs Machine is when 6 players work as a team to prevent waves of invading robots deploying a bomb at a certain point. As you advance through, the waves of robots begin to get increasingly more diffcult. There is also a \"Mann Up\" version. This is the official version of Mann Vs Machine played on offical Valve Mann Up servers. In order to get into these servers, you would need to purchase a \"Tour Of Duty Ticket\". After you complete a mission , you earn a pile of loot which you get at the end when it is \"Victory\" Time. When you complete a Tour Of Duty, you would get normal weapons, Botkiller weapons, Killstreak Kit, an Australium Weapon and many more. TF2 has also many custom mod servers which consist of unoffical gamemodes. Some of these mods are TF2ware and Versus Saxton Hale. The best feature of Team Fortress 2 is that there is always update which contain new items, weapons,weapons changes, maps, gamemodes and THEY ARE ALL FREE OF CHARGE!!! This says when you go on Team Fortress 2, there is always new content to enjoy. TF2 also celebrates special events such as Halloween and particular maps change their looks to match the event. In these events, they are special event only items that you can acquire. Team Fortress 2 are just those games that get very hard to bored of. They can get so addicting that you would just play them all day. NOT TO FORGET, IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE HATS. TF2 is an absolute MASTERPIECE!!!!! I give this game overall 1,000,000,000/10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "profile_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/id/AnimeGamerFTW", "username": "SteveTF2gamer620", "friend_player_level": null, "num_reviews": 0, "num_groups": null, "num_found_helpful": 66, "rating": "Recommended", "num_screenshots": 0, "num_found_funny": 0, "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_possible": null, "num_achievements_percentage": null, "num_achievements_attained": null}, "num_friends": null, "num_workshop_items": 0, "steam_id_number": "AnimeGamerFTW", "num_comments": 1, "num_voted_helpfulness": 77, "num_guides": 0, "date_posted": "Jan 19, 2014, 4:49PM", "num_badges": null}

It used to be paid, but it went free to play in 2011. The graphics, despite being a bit old already, still look good and stylish. The maps are usually well-designed and interesting to look at. The gameplay stands out from your other FPS games for being very different than conventional shooters out there. You can pick from nine different classes: offensive (Scout, Soldier, Pyro), defensive (Demo, Heavy, Engineer) and support (Medic, Sniper, Spy), each with their own unique tools, style, strengths and weaknesses. This forces you to work with your teammates to cover each other's weakpoints and emerge victorious. There are two main gamemodes: PvP and MvM. The former has a lot of sub-modes, such as Payload, Control Points, Attack / Defense, King of the Hill, or Capture The Flag. The latter, on the other hand, pits a team of six players in a co-op tower defense mode against hordes of bloodthirsty robots, with the objective of preventing them from delivering a bomb to the end of the map. There is a lot of unlockable weapons, which allow you to customize and change your gameplay style, as well as a ton (and I mean a ton ) of cosmetic items, which serve no purpose besides looking cool. The music, while it can't be heard outside of main menu or promotional videos, is very good and fun to listen to even outside the game. Unfortunately, this game also has cons. Due to the amount of hats content, the game is very heavy, so computers that aren't brand-new might experience some performance issues. Also, due to it being free to play, pub servers are often filled with noobs who have no idea what they're doing, which can destroy your gaming experience considering the game is teamwork-reliant. Multiple Snipers and Spies is a common occurence. The community is also... well, not the worst, but one of the worst. Just a quick glance at the forums reveals a ton of unusual and Australium-toting \"git gud\" elitists who aren't very pleasant to talk to if you're new... or in general.

I say this for it is the most honest and veritable truth. Quite close to the objective Idea of Truth, to estimate it properly. At first I held the opinion that Collective Fortification II was merely another dull, boring and uninteresting ludum of the general significance and craftsmanship as Summoning of Obligation. However, this was in advance of the actual attempt at undergoing the experience of Collective Fortification II, which is, in hindsight, presumptuous and bold. Contrary to whatever estimation I conferred to Collective Fortification II in the past before, mind you, partaking in the adventure that is Collective Fortification II, I must declare with due expertise that this ludum is marvelous! In this ludum one will find a most engaging experience worthy of eternal estimation in the irrefutable and absolute realm of Do Desire. Certainly, anyone who would claim that this ludum is not worthy of said realm would be a scoundrel, a fraud and a lout. Yes, the sheer dilly-dallying that is facilitated in this ludum is thus charming that one such as I, one who could be described as paresseux comme baise, would scribe a true pinnacle of summitous apexity in the latitudes of criticisms. And thus, at the decisive terminal of this criticism I would implore you, my venerable gentleman or gentlewoman, to amuse yourself with this ludum of exceptional excellence. Now, my treasured asinine, experience the wonder that is Collective Fortification II with your personal senses by embarking on the quest that is this ludum! Godspeed and have a good evening by now.

So sit tight, you are in for a long ride. Let's get the verdict out of the way before getting to the real talk: I recommend this game. I have spent hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars on it. Is it worth playing? Yes. Is it worth investing your time for a deeper experience? Probably not. I already predict a lot of hate for this review, but I need to get it off my chest and explain the issues I have with this game. Once again those are my own opinions that a lot of people happen to share. It is completely fine if you want to argue against it, I will just ask you to be honest and less defensive because TF2 is in a critical state. First of all, I'd like to point out that I've spent 1780 hours, which might be low for some, high for others. I started playing in late 2009-early 2010 in intervals of several months between late 2010 and early 2012. I enjoyed this game a lot since it was a fresh change from the FPS games I used to play back in the days (CoD 2/4 or CS). It was extremely fun, and trust me, I do not regret a single minute I've spent on this game, before early 2014 at least. I'm not really the Shakespeare of game reviews, and English doesn't happen to be my first language, but I'll do my best to explain my points clearly. I'm going to spend some time explaining each major part (IMO) of TF2: Competitive, Trading, Community, and Updates. I - Competitive: Why do I want to list this subject first? Simply because this will be a quick talk: Competitive TF2 is basically the best place where you can fully enjoy TF2. The competitive community is mostly made of good and helpful people. You will play the game the way it should've been played, whether it's a lobby, pug or a UGC match. For my part, I didn't really want to get into UGC because unfortunately I was already getting into CS:GO and couldn't get the time to look for a team, even though I played pugs with and against silver/gold teams. II - Trading: We had the good part, now the not so good-decent part. Barely spent anytime there. I never got interested in it mainly because I'm not patient, and I can get the thing I need directly without spending 3 years working for a bigger backpack. Most of TF2 is usually into trading, whether they spend 1 hour a month or 23 hours a day in a trading website/server. The trading community is really mixed. It has good people in it, but it also has scammers and some self-centered losers. Yet, this is where I got to meet a lot of good friends, and where I've been amazed by a lot of idiots thinking they have the networth of the 1% in their inventory. At the current state of the game, according to many professional traders, unless you have some insane item, you won't make any profit. With all the useless hats added, the supply of cosmetics is insanely high, the demand is scattered and the value the currency holds keeps dropping, dragging everything down with it. In short, trade if you want, but watch out for scammers and sharks and stick with the good people. There aren't many, but they are out there. Trading would've been one of the strengths of TF2 if Valve and the heads of some communities didn't ruin it. III - Community: It's really mixed. You can find good people if you go to the right pubs, as well as s who will instantly kick you if you aren't a \"friendly heavy\" or \"ruin the conga\" or w/e. I wasn't lucky with Valve servers as well. Most of the times I played in those servers I was left with autistic meme spouters, 300 ping brazilians or  who will call you a tryhard if you simply try to play the game as intended. Some people also blame bronies or furries for making it worse. I honestly don't care about both, I had to witness a lot of pubs with regulars I've enjoyed playing with dying, and if there is something to blame it is not one of the game's communities such as the ones cited above, but rather the direction the game is currently taking. IV - Updates: The game is making a terrible turn. It went from a game that could've been a success in eSports to a casual cash-grabber made to attract more people into Steam. They keep on adding useless lore-breaking cosmetics aswell as useless weapons that keep on making the game worse. Many want Valve to add more weapons to the game - I don't. You have to understand that the point of unlocks are, or were to be very situational items and could also act as a costly alternative such as the Gunboats. Some weapons now are either completely useless such as the new grenade launcher or the Back Scatter or completely random such as the Base Jumper or the Tide Turner. Many people are complaining about EoTL for being one of the worst updates possible to the game. It was overhyped by you guys because you couldn't understand that this was the way Valve wants the game to be. Don't blame those who made EoTL, the ones to blame are those in charge of TF2. They had then to throw in a broken  game mode that seemed to be coded within a day, as well as a couple of useless weapons or taunts to calm the community down after the disaster.The sad part is that it worked. The game is now 8 years old and still a success for the wrong reasons; but how long is it going to last before more and more people get tired by the way Valve handles the game? Once again, most of these are based on my opinions as well as the opinions of others. I hope this might be useful for some. I had to write it to unleash the anger I had against the incompetent team supposed to replace the original developers. So go ahead, enjoy the game, play it as its fullest. If you've never played this game you are missing something, so do it now while it lasts.

Best game I've ever seen in my life. When I started playing tf2, I only played it for the gameplay. It was (and still is) real fun to play. But after some months, I discovered trading. The wonderful trading. After months of trading, I learned a lot about it. And now, I do it almost every day! It will always be my hobby. c: It's even a great way to earn money! :D I have to say, there aren't that much weapons. There are more cosmetics then weapons. I'm not really a fan of cosmetics, I prefer have weapons (that's why I almost have them all, except 5). And when there comes new items during an update, then that are only cosmetics/reskins of weapons/weapons in an other quality. For now the qualities that are coming more of: Strange and Collector's. Collector's is a new, and pretty expensive quality, but not really diffirent then the 'unique' quality. And Strange is a quality that counts kills/points/etc that you made with the weapon/misc that's in this quality. I'm a truly fan of Strange weapons, and I own 41 out of 120 (this is except Australiums, Botkillers and Festives, because that are 'just' reskins) Someday I'll buy the rest of them too :D Alright, I told pretty much I guess, and I hope this review was useful for you.

I would describe it more as a social hub for people to hang out. This game have two teams that are supposed to fight each other, but only in Team Fortress 2 with two people of the opposite team giving each other high fives, stop fighting during the game and walk around crouching, or dance together! There are nine classes divided into three groups; offense, defense and support. But Team Fortress 2 have changed so much since release that it does not really mean anything anymore. Pretty much every class can function as any of the three groups with the right loadout, but they are still very different from each other. You got a fast Scout with little health, and a slow Heavy with a lot of health, and anything inbetween that! There is no way you will not find a class you prefer sticking to. Valve never added a new class, but they added tons of weapons! Some of them are really silly (punch an enemy in the back to make him stop and laugh, a great way to get silly taunt kills!), while others generally are a big improvement over the stock weapons (like the Degreaser). However most of the weapons are very situational and I prefer the stock weapons. There are many game modes to play. Capture the point, capture the flag. Payload where you push a cart through the map while the other team try preventing you from doing it, and if you're a fan of tower defense, you will enjoy Mann Vs. Machine! You're a team of up to six people who are supposed to kill a huge army of robots before they move their bomb to your base. Some of them are small, others are big and really hurts, and others are big and runs fast. But what really makes this game mode different from the more traditional Team Fortress 2, is you can upgrade your weapons. Fire speed, damage, reload speed, damage resistances, running speed, jump speed and so on. It is really fun, and if you are lucky you can win a huge prize for completing a Tour! Cosmetic items are a huge deal for many people. Hats! There are so many hats in this game, and they are all so different. There is no way you are not going to find one you like and will wear and be proud to wear every time you play. Many of the cosmetics can also be painted into your favourite colour! Team Fortress 2 is free to play. Is it pay to win? No. All the weapons you see in the store, are weapons you can get simply by playing, or you can use items to craft the weapon you want. If you buy premium you will receive weapons faster, your backpack will be larger so you can keep more items, and you can trade with others. Trading is a good way to get the weapon you're looking for.

Basic info. Genre: Action Brief summary In Team Fortress 2, the player can choose to play as 9 different character classes, all of which feature a unique set of attributes, customizable weapons and special equipment, join a team of other players and either compete with an opposing team for a principal objective or cooperate with their teammates against an AI. Critical commentary | Essential value: Pros & Cons Pros: It's an examplatory multiplayer FPS game. It's F2P. The cartoon-like in-game graphics are cool. The soundtrack is really amazing. It's an excellent way to get socialised and to meet fellow gamers, since its community is gigantic and evergrowing. There are at least 2-3 major updates per year, including annual Halloween and Christmas events, and several bug fixes once in a while. It features 500+ well-made Steam Achievements. It provides the player with the ability to adapt the characters' loadouts to their personal combat preferences and capabilities by fully customizing them, as well as to dress their mercenaries with several cosmetic items. Thus, they are able to create an ideal combination of items that will maximize their potential. There are multiple types of game categories (including Capture the Flag, Control Point, King of the Hill, Payload etc), as well as various maps and levels, and as a result it's almost impossible for the player to get bored. Cons: It requires money in order to upgrade your account to premium, to buy most of the fancy, nonetheless useless and unnecessary, gear and, in general, to take part in the main economic system. At the beginning, it seems difficult and complicated due to the vast variety of weapons, equipment and cosmetic items, maps and locations. However, the more you play the game, the easier and the simpler it becomes. It may become extremely addictive.
